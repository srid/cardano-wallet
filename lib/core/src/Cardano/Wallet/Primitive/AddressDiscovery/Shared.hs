-- | Shared wallet is a new kind of wallet owned by one or more co-signers.
-- In this type of the wallet, addresses are defined by two monetary scripts
-- (one for the ownership of assets and the other one for the ownership of stake).
-- The two scripts can be the same, different, also the script for the ownership of stake
-- can be absent.
--
-- The shared wallet can be in two states: pending or ready. In a pending state the wallet
-- does not have account public keys for all co-signers, and hence discovery of script addresses
-- co-shared with other co-signers is not possible. In a ready state the wallet has account public
-- keys for all co-signers and co-shared script address discovery is possible.
--
-- The shared wallet is instantiated with an account public key, derivation path needed to
-- recreate it for a holder of this shared wallet, ie., one of the co-signers.
-- In order to construct corectly the wallet, ie., enable co-shared script addresses discovery
-- the following is needed:
--
-- - a way to determine what range of indices are checked on the
--   ledger. Mechanism of address pool, also adopted for sequential wallets,
--   is used. The idea is to track all indices starting from 0 and up to N.
--   N is variable as addresses are discovered (and marked as Used in consequence).
--   The pool of addresses is enlarged in such way that the number of consecutive
--   Unsed addresses equals to address pool gap of the address pool. Hence,
--   the address pool gap needs to be specified.
--
-- - script template for payment credential contains information about all collected
--   account public keys for all parties engaged, here named co-signers. Also the skeleton
--   determining script structure is provided. In this sense script is predetermined from
--   the beginning and can variate only in verification key part that replaces co-signers in the
--   script skeleton. The places where a specific cosigner is present is to be replaced
--   with the derived verfication key using the co-signer's account public key and
--   the index that was chosen. This is the reason why we need complete set of account public keys for
--   each co-signer to realize address discovery. The script template can be translated into
--   a corresponding script, which hash is used in the address, only when account public keys
--   for all cosigners specified in script are collected.The index for derivation is the same
--   for each cosigner's derivation. The same index is used in both scripts that represent
--   payment or delegation credential. Verification keys are derived
--   using role=3 for payment credential.
--
-- - optional script template for delegation credential contains all information as in case of
--   the script template for payment credential. One difference is that the verification keys are derived
--   using role=4 for delegation credential.
--
-- When both script are present, the base address (with both credentials) is expected to be discovered.
-- When script template for delegation credential is missing then enterprise address (non-stakable) is
-- expected.
